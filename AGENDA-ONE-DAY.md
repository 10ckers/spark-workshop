# Spark and Scala Workshop for Developers (1 Day)

## What You Will Learn (aka Goals)

This one-day Spark and Scala workshop is supposed to give you a practical and hands-on introduction to the architecture of Apache Spark and the tools that you use to develop Spark applicatons in your Big Data projects.

The workshop uses an intense code-first approach in which the modules start with just enough knowledge to get you going (using slides, scaladoc and live coding) and quickly move on to applying the concepts in programming assignments. There are a lot of them.

The programming language to use during the course is [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

_Your dear drill sergeant, Jacek._
