# Spark Workshop

This project serves as a checkpoint to get you prepared (software-wise) for the **Spark and Scala Workshop** run by [Jacek Laskowski](https://twitter.com/jaceklaskowski).

`git clone` it first and execute `sbt test` in the cloned project's directory.

```
$ sbt test
...
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 3 s, completed Mar 10, 2016 10:37:26 PM
```

You should see `[info] All tests passed.` to consider yourself prepared.
