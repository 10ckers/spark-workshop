# Spark and Scala (Application Development) Workshop

## What You Will Learn (aka Goals)

This Spark and Scala workshop is supposed to give you a practical, complete and more importantly hands-on introduction to the architecture of Apache Spark and how to use Spark's Scala API (developer) and infrastructure (administrator, devops) effectively in your Big Data projects.

**NOTE**: Should you want a workshop about administration, monitoring, troubleshooting and fine-tuning of Apache Spark, check out [Spark Administration and Monitoring Workshop](AGENDA-admin.md).

The agenda is the result of the workshops I hosted in the following cities and a few online classes:

* Toronto (3 classes)
* Mississauga
* Plymouth Meeting
* Montreal
* London

The workshop uses an intense code-first approach in which the modules start with just enough knowledge to get you going (mostly using scaladoc and live coding) and quickly move on to applying the concepts in programming assignments. There are a lot of them.

It comes with many practical sessions that should meet (and even exceed) expectations of software developers (and perhaps administrators, operators, devops, and other technical roles like system architects or technical leads).

The workshop provides participants with practical skills to use the features of Apache Spark with Scala.

**CAUTION**: The Spark and Scala workshop is very hands-on and practical, i.e. not for faint-hearted. _Seriously!_ After 5 days your mind, eyes, and hands will all be trained to recognise the patterns where and how to use Spark and Scala in your Big Data projects.

**CAUTION** I have already trained people who expressed their concern that there were too many exercises. _Your dear drill sergeant, Jacek._

## Duration

5 days

## Target Audience

* Software developers who know Scala and want to explore the Spark space
* Software developers with programming experience in a similar general-purpose programming language (Java, Python, Ruby)
* Non-programming IT professionals like administrators, devops, system architects or technical leads to learn about Spark and Scala by their APIs.

## Outcomes

After completing the workshop participants should be able to:

* Use functional programming concepts in Scala
* Describe Spark and the use cases for Apache Spark
* Explain the RDD distributed data abstraction
* Explore large datasets using interactive Spark Shell
* Develop Spark applications using Scala API
* Assemble and submit Spark applications to Spark clusters
* Use Spark in local mode as well as Spark Standalone clusters
* Install Spark development and runtime environments
* Understand the concepts of Spark SQL (DataFrame, Dataset, UDF)
* Understand the concepts of Spark Streaming (DStream, ReceiverInputDStream)
* Understand the concepts of Spark MLlib (Pipeline API)
* Understand the concepts of Spark GraphX (RDD-based Graph API)
* Build processing pipelines using Spark's RDD and abstractions above in Spark SQL (DataFrame), Spark Streaming (DStream), and Spark MLlib (Pipeline API).
* Explain the internals of Spark and execution model

## Agenda

The programming language to use during the course is [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). There is a one-day "crash course" to the language during the workshop. It is optional for skilled Scala developers who are familiar with the fundamentals of Scala and sbt.

### Scala (one-day crash course)

This module aims at introducing Scala and the tools, i.e. **sbt** and **Scala REPL**, to complete the other Spark modules.

This module requires Internet access to download sbt and plugins (unless you `git clone` the repository - see [README](README.md)).

This module covers:

* Scala REPL
* Literals and Values
* Basic Types (Numerics, Strings)
* Type System
* Imports
* More Advanced Types (Tuples, Options)
  * Parameterized Types
* Expressions and Conditions
* Methods, Functions (and Procedures)
  * Using placeholders (`_`) in functions
* Scala Collection API and Common Collection Types
  * Seqs, Lists, Sets, Maps
  * The scaladoc of [scala.collection.Seq](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Seq)
  * `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `zipWithIndex`, `count`
* Implicits and Multiple Parameter Lists
  * Understanding method signatures
* Case Classes, Objects, and Traits
* Command-line Applications
* Packages
* Pattern Matching
* Partial Functions
  * Using `case` to destructure input parameters
  * [Seq.collect][1]
* sbt - the build tool for Scala projects
