Dear Participants,

I'm Jacek Laskowski who is your trainer for the Spark and Scala Workshop in [city] next week, from [start-date] to [end-date].

All classes start at 9am and end at 5pm with 1-hour lunch break in-between.

Before we start the class I ask you to prepare your local development environment. Please follow the instructions at https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop#spark-and-scala-workshop.

If you're on Windows, you need to go the extra mile and follow the instructions at https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/content/spark-tips-and-tricks-running-spark-windows.html. Due to the way Hive integration in Spark works on Windows, you need to have Administrator rights to complete the step.

You do not need root or Administrator rights for the Spark and Scala Workshop.

Please respond to the email (directly to me without others CC'ed) with information about your operating system, your configuration status, and what are your expectations from the workshop.

Should you have any questions, doubts, concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. See you on [start-date]!

Best,
Jacek
