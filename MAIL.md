SUBJECT: Welcome to Spark and Scala Workshop in [city] - [start-date] to [end-date]

Dear Participants,

Welcome to Spark and Scala Workshop in [city], from [start-date] to [end-date]!

I'm Jacek Laskowski who is the trainer for the workshop.

All classes start at 9am and end at 5pm with a 1-hour lunch break in-between. 10-minute breaks are also included.

Before we start the class I'd like to ask you to prepare your local development environment for the workshop. Please follow the instructions at https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop#spark-and-scala-workshop.

If you're on Windows, you need to go the extra mile and follow the instructions at https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/content/spark-tips-and-tricks-running-spark-windows.html. Due to the way Hive integration in Spark works on Windows, you need to have Administrator rights to complete the step. There is a Docker image if you get stuck with the setup - see https://github.com/jaceklaskowski/spark-workshop#docker-image.

You do not need root or Administrator rights for the Spark and Scala Workshop (unless you are on Windows).

Please respond to the email (directly to me without others CC'ed) with information about your operating system, your configuration status, and what are your expectations from the workshop. I really need to talk to you in advance to match the agenda to you.

Should you have any questions, doubts, concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. Hearing from you this week!

Best,
Jacek
